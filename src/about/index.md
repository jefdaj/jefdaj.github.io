Welcome to <b>Code Island</b>!

It's your standard programmer blog, but with [shorter posts][zettel-posts].
I'll try to keep it fun by rambling less and adding more visuals.

I go by *jefdaj* online.
Here are some places you can contact me:

- [Github](https://github.com/jefdaj)
- Email (personal, UC Berkeley)
- Twitter
- Secure Scuttlebutt
- Meetup
<!-- - Reddit -->

<!-- TODO gpg? bitmessage? -->
