title: Plutus intro
tags: plutus, smart contracts
...

Welcome to the first in a series of posts wherein I try to learn [smart
contract][smart-contract] development by teaching it. I'll aim to do at least a
couple short sessions per week, largely based on the [Plutus smart
contracts][leanpub] ebook. First, a few things this series is not:

* It's not a substitute for reading the book
* It's not a substitute for learning Haskell
* It's not very well organized or even fully Plutus-focused

Instead of trying to make a complete guide, I'll just start expanding on parts
of the book that I found confusing as a Haskell developer with no prior
blockchain experience, and then progress to mocking up naive implementations of
some interesting dApp ideas. Along the way there will probably be comparisons
to Marlowe, Solidity, and traditional programming paradigms. I hope it becomes a
useful supplement to the many other available resources.

That said, [let me know](/about.html) if you want more about a particular
topic: Haskell, Solidity, blockchain, type theory, Nix, whatever! Or correct
something I did wrong. It's all very interdisciplinary, and everyone starts
with a different subset of the skills. I might not know what I don't know, or
what you don't know.
