title: How to use this blog
tags: blog, github, writing
...

Each post is intended to be a quick "bite-sized" read rather than anything
comprehensive. That's partly to avoid wasting your time, and partly to make it
less daunting for me to make a habit of writing every day.

If you get interested in something you should explore other similarly-tagged
posts for context, and then branch out into primary sources or [ask me][me] to expand
on it if things are still unclear. I love constructive feedback!

The site is [hosted on Github][github]. The `master` branch holds unreadable
compiled HTML; start [here][posts] on the `develop` branch instead for the
actual source code of each post.
