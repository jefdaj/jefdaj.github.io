title: How to use this blog
tags: blog, zettelkasten
...

Each post is intended to be as short as possible. That's partly to avoid
wasting your time, and partly to make it less daunting for me to write every
day.

Sometimes they'll be very short, more like a zettel (a hyperlinked note in the
[zettelkasten][zettel] style) than a traditional full-length article. If you
get interested but something seems to be missing, try exploring linked and similarly-tagged
posts. Hopefully it makes sense in context. If not, please [let me know about it][about].

Also, please tell me if I messed something else up.
I want all the constructive feedback!
