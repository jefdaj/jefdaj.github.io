title: How to use this blog
tags: blog, github, writing, zettelkasten
...

Each post is intended to be a quick "bite-sized" read on a narrow topic, more
like a [Zettelkasten][zettel] note (a "zettel") than a traditional
full-length article. That's partly to avoid wasting your time, and partly to
make it less daunting for me to write every day.

If you get interested in something you should explore linked and similarly-tagged
posts, then branch out into the primary sources or [ask me][me] to expand
on the topic if things are still unclear. I love constructive feedback!

The site is [hosted on Github][github]. The `master` branch holds unreadable
compiled HTML; start [here][posts] on the `develop` branch instead. Each post
is a folder with an `index.md` (like [this][this]) and possibly other files:
pictures, standalone scripts you can download and run, etc.
