title: How to use this blog
tags: blog, github, writing
...

Each post is intended to be a quick "bite-sized" read, more like a
[Zettel][zettel] than than a full-length article. That's partly to avoid
wasting your time, and partly to make it less daunting for me to write every
day.

If you get interested in something you should explore linked and similarly-tagged
posts for context, and then branch out into primary sources or [ask me][me] to expand
on it if things are still unclear. I love constructive feedback!

The site is [hosted on Github][github]. The `master` branch holds unreadable
compiled HTML; start [here][posts] on the `develop` branch instead for the
actual source code of each post.
