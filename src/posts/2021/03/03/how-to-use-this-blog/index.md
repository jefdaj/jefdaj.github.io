title: How to use this blog
tags: blog, writing, zettelkasten
...

Each post is intended to be a quick bite-sized read on a narrow topic, more
like a zettel (a hyperlinked note in the [zettelkasten][zettel] style) than a
traditional full-length article. That's partly to avoid wasting your time, and
partly to make it less daunting for me to write every day.

If you get interested in something you should explore linked and similarly-tagged
posts, then branch out into the primary sources or [ask me][about] to expand
on the topic if things are still unclear.

Also, please tell me if I messed something up.
I want all the constructive feedback!
